This extension was formed by merging the other two.
Namely:
PrecisionTouchPadSwipe: Author - Valstop (Link: https: //addons.mozilla.org/en/firefox/user/12254872/? Utm_source = firefox-browser & utm_medium = firefox-browser & utm_content = addons-manager-user-profile-link)

AND

Swipe Back: Author - anuejn (Link: https: //addons.mozilla.org/ru/firefox/user/17076876/? Utm_source = firefox-browser & utm_medium = firefox-browser & utm_content = addons-manager-user-profile-link)

The purpose of this act is to support gestures in firefox on wayland. The second extension does not work correctly (it may be possible to customize it), and the first does not have animation. I do not claim authorship and did it for myself, but I would be glad if it would be useful to someone.
